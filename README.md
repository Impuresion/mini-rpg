<h2>Why this repository exists?</h2>
<p>I decided to create this repository because i was proud for myself, that i'm learned a little part of JavaScript, using very comfortable way to tudy - step-by-step developing with pretty easy tasks on every step (such as "Create a <div> component").</p>
<p>This project is way to show that i can improve my skills and growth in programming</p>
